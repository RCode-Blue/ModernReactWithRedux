A reducer is  function that returns a piece of the application state
Application state is generated by reducers

Container = A component that has direct access to state that is produced by Redux.
            Whenever state changes, the container will re-render.

To form a connection between a container (state - Redux) and a component (data - React),  we need to use the 'react-redux' library

eg:
{
    // Books Reducer
    books: [                    // key of state
        {title: "Harry Potter}, // value of state, also th output of the books reducer
        {title: "Javascript"}
    ],

    // ActiveBook Reducer
    activeBook: { 
        title: "JavaScript: the Good Parts" 
    }
}
